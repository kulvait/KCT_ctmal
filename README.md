# CT Mathematics/Algebraic Library

Mathematic/Algebraic algorithms for supporting CTÂ data manipulation.

## Cloning repository:

Clone over ssh, for those with ssh keys ready in gitlab
```
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.stimulate.ovgu.de:2200/vojtech.kulvait/CTMAL.git
```
Basic clone can be performed over https
```
git clone https://gitlab.stimulate.ovgu.de/vojtech.kulvait/CTMAL.git
```
However to populate submodules directories it is then needed to issue
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Submodules

Submodules lives in the submodules directory. To clone project including submodules one have to use the following commands

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
or use the following command when cloning repository

```
git clone --recurse-submodules
```
We use relative [url](https://www.gniibe.org/memo/software/git/using-submodule.html) to improve experience for http protocol users.

## How to build:
For build process, make and cmake utilities are required. Install them using
```
apt-get install make cmake
```


Please create separate directory and build there
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Required libraries
Intel MKL

This library is important for LAPACK routines.

## Using IDEs

#Eclipse
For eclipse to work, create out of source project that is not child or ancesor of the parent directory.
Run the following to generate eclipse project
```
cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug path_to_project
```
After each change in CMakeLists.txt remove eclipse project and regenerate it.
